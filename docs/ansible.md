- Automation for Everyone

# Use Cases

COMPLETE IT AUTOMATION
Ansible seamlessly unites workflow orchestration with configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in one easy-to-use and deploy platform.

Regardless of where you start with Ansible, you’ll find our simple, powerful and agentless automation platform has the capabilities to solve your most challenging problems.

# Integrations

Ansible includes hundreds of modules to support a wide variety of IT integrations, including:

Automate Anything
Your IT environment is much more than just a collection of servers and configurations. Ansible was designed and built to ensure that everyone in your IT organization can start automating their tasks in ways that were just not possible before.

In order to be effective, everyone in the IT organization needs to play a part in automating their view of the environment. The benefits are clear: by automating the repetition out of their daily lives, IT team members are able to focus on more interesting value-added tasks.

1. Infrastructure
Regardless of who your infrastructure vendors are, Ansible can help you automate all your infrastructure from bare metal to virtualization - all without having to expose credentials, or teach your users the specific UIs and APIs for each provider.

- Virtualization
Ansible supports industry-leading virtualization platforms that you’re already using today, including:

VMware
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV)
Libvirt
Xenserver
Vagrant

- Operating Systems
Ansible supports the operating systems that keep your business running, including:

Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, and others)
Windows and Windows Server
UNIX

2. Networks
It’s time that the network teams got to participate in the DevOps revolution. Ansible brings its simplicity and agentless architecture to network automation in a way that enables IT organizations to finally include network teams in DevOps initiatives while simultaneously gaining better control and understanding of how their existing networks are configured and managed.

Ansible supports a wide variety of network providers today, including:

A10
Arista
Cisco
Cumulus Networks
Dell
F5 BigIP
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (OpenSwitch)
Juniper
Nokia
Palo Alto Networks
and others

3. Containers
IT organizations are looking for ways to containerize all the things. Ansible can help by standardizing, controlling, and automating the build process for containers, as well as ensuring there’s a sane and predictable (as well as supportable) lifecycle from developer workstation to test to QA to production. Ansible takes the guesswork out of the likely question: “Where did that container come from, and what’s it running?” Today, that means building and managing Docker, and LXC images, but also the next big thing none of us have even heard of yet.

Ansible supports containers, including:

Ansible Container
Docker
Linux Containers (LXC)

4. Cloud
 Ansible has deep and broad capabilities across the cloud ecosystem-- on or off-prem, or a bit of both, Ansible can seamlessly automate in an increasingly hybrid world.

Ultimately, Ansible gives teams the one thing they can never get enough of: time. Allowing smart people to focus on smart things.

Ansible is a simple automation language that can perfectly describe an IT application infrastructure. It’s easy-to-learn, self-documenting, and doesn’t require a grad-level computer science degree to read. Automation shouldn’t be more complex than the tasks it’s replacing.
