## Python Concepts

# Interpreter vs Compiler

| Interpreter | Compiler |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Translates program one statement at a time. | Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code. |
| It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower. | It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster. |
| No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient. | Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. |
| Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy. | It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard. |
| Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters. | Programming language like C, C++ use compilers. |
