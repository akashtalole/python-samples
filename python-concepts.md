## Python Concepts

# Interpreted vs compiled

# Interpreter

..* Translates program one statement at a time.
..* It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower.
..* No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient.
..* Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy.
..* Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters.

# Compiler

..* Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
..* It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster.
..* Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory.
..* It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is comparatively hard.
..* Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.

# List vs Tuples
